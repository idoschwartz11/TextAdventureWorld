I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter but never go outside.|Keyboard|I am a computer part.
I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind.|Echo|I am a sound reflection.
The more of this there is, the less you see.|Darkness|You need a torch to beat me.
I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees.I have water, but no fish.|Map|You use me to find your way.
